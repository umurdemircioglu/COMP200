;c which is 4 + 5 = 9 then double which is 18 and one more double is 36 so value:36

(define times-2 double)
; creating a new procedure which is times-2.

(times-2 c)
;times-2 is defined as double and c is 4 so value:8

(define d c)
; assign c to d

(= c d)
; checks if c and d equal and gives true

(cond ((>= c 2) d)

      (else (abs (- c d))))
; in the first part of the condition it tells us if c is bigger or equal to 2 return d. We know that c is 4 so it will return d and since we assigned c to d it will return 4.

;3 A parameter that controls parsing and printing of symbols. When this parameterâ€™s value
;is #f, the reader case-folds symbols (e.g., producing 'hi when the input is any one of hi,
;Hi, HI, or hI). The parameter also affects the way that write prints symbols containing.
